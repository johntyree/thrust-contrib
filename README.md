thrust-contrib
==============

Beta-level user contributed additions to the thrust library.

These additions to the thrust library are in no way guaranteed to do anything
whatsoever. They are implementations of iterators and functions which are not
present in Thrust, but remain useful. It's annoying to have to constantly define
the same simple functors and iterators over and over.

Please contribute.
